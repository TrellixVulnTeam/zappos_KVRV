Zappos Summer Interview Coding Challenge
========================================

When running zappos.py, it will ask you for three parameters
1. What kind of item are you looking to purchase? (Added this myself, hope that's okay!)
2. How many items do you want?
3. Around how much are you willing to spend?

After inputting the answers, zappos.py will throw out a list of suitable items that matches your ideal spending-spree range.

To re-run the file, simply press anything to exit after the list is printed out, and re-open the file.
